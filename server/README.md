## 🔌 API Endpoints

### Health Check

### Check MP3 Cache
```

  "artist": "Artist Name",

}
```

```json
{
  "cached": true,
  "mp3Url": "http://localhost:3001/mp3files/artist_name-song_title.mp3",
  "filename": "artist_name-song_title.mp3"
}
```

```json
{
  "cached": false
}
```

### Extract MP3
```
POST /get-mp3

}

> **Note**: If `artist` and `song` are provided, the file is saved as `artist-song.mp3` (sanitized). Otherwise, falls back to `video_title_timestamp.mp3`.

### List MP3 Files
```
GET /mp3files/list
```
Returns list of all downloaded MP3 files.

### Delete MP3 File
```
DELETE /mp3files/:filename
```
Deletes a specific MP3 file.

### Clear All MP3 Files
```
DELETE /mp3files/clear
```

## 📁 File Storage

MP3 files are stored in the `mp3files/` directory. Files are served statically at:
```
GET /mp3files/:filename
```

### Naming Convention
Files are saved as `artist_name-song_title.mp3`:
- Lowercase
- Spaces replaced with underscores
- Special characters removed
- Example: `Taylor Swift - Blank Space` → `taylor_swift-blank_space.mp3`

## ⚠️ Notes

- Downloaded MP3 files can be large - clear periodically with `DELETE /mp3files/clear`
- The server uses CORS to allow requests from the React frontend (localhost:3000)
- yt-dlp and ffmpeg executables should be in this folder (Windows) or system PATH
